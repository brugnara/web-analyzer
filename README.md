web-analyzer

<<<<<<< HEAD

# Why

I need a tool that analyze a huge amount of web sites and extract from each one the what it wrotes about.

# How

```
var Analyzer = require('web-analyzer');

var an = new Analyzer();

an.queue('http://repubblica.it');
```

# Todo

- Improve **auto-keywords** module to filter elements with at least X count
- Drop **<script>** content
- understand what the sites are talking about based on meta/title and content.
